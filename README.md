# **CVE-2020-16899**

CVE-2020-16899 - Microsoft Windows TCP/IP Denial of Service Vulnerability

Microsoft released an additional vulnerability that is highly similar to "Bad Neighbor" (CVE-2020-16898), but results in a remote BSOD, and does not appear to lead to code execution. We decided to release a Suricata signature and Lua script for this vulnerability as well.

The Suricata signature for this vulnerability is located in [cve-2020-16899.rules](/cve-2020-16899.rules) and contains the following logic:

*alert icmp any any -> any any (msg:"Potential CVE-2020-16899 Exploit"; lua:**cve-2020-16899.lua**; sid:202016899; rev:1;)*

The corresponding Lua script may be found in [cve-2020-16899.lua](/cve-2020-16899.lua).
